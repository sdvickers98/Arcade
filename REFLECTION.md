1. **DONE:** Set up tetris grid, tetromino creation, and key events. For checkers,
   set up the board, pieces, and basic movements as well as captures.

2. **TODO:** Continue working on the tetromino movement as well as row clearing in 
   Tetris. In checkers, add the kings, dialog boxes, and displaying/saving scores.
